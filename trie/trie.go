// is in the raw format(32 bytes).

// bytes are converted to the hexary nibbles and composited with the parent path
// if the trie node is in a layered trie.

// It's used by state sync and commit to allow handling external references
// between account and storage tries. And also it's used in the state healing
// for extracting the raw states(leaf nodes) with corresponding paths.
